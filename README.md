# gatorblocks-python
This is the gator blocks algorithm, starting with proof of concept in python. The concept was sucessfully converted to Java and then to a full fledged android app, the repository is available under gatorblocks-wear
Important points:
1. The gatorblocks proof of concept is what the user will run
2. Gatorblocks algorithm is some old code that may come in useful, it is my original script
