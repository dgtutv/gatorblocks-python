# gatorblocks-python
This is the gator blocks algorithm, starting with proof of concept in python. I hope to make the program more user friendly, and eventually convert the code to java for use in android studio, creating a watch version of the app.
Important points:
1. The gatorblocks proof of concept is what the user will run
2. Gatorblocks algorithm is some old code that may come in useful, it is my original script
