# gatorblocks-python
This is the gator blocks algorithm, starting with proof of concept in python. I hope to make the program more user friendly, and eventually convert the code to java for use in android studio, creating a watch version of the app.
Important points:
1. The gatorblocks proof of concept is what the user will run
2. Gatorblocks algorithm is some old code that may come in useful, it is my original script
3. Gatorblocks classes is a list of the users classes, in future I plan to add a user friendily way to change the classes in this list
4. Gatorblocks days off lists all of the given days off, excluding summer break and weekends, as the algorithm accounts for it
5. Help would be much appreciated!!
